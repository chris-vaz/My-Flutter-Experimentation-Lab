# üöÄ Flutter Learning Sandbox

## A Personal Laboratory for Dart & Flutter Development

This repository serves as my dedicated space for hands-on practice, experimentation, and mastery of the **Flutter framework** and the **Dart language**. The primary goal is to build a strong foundation in mobile development, explore advanced widget techniques, and prepare for future freelance projects.

## üéØ Project Goals

This sandbox is focused on achieving the following learning objectives:

* **Core Fundamentals:** Solidifying understanding of **Stateful** vs. **Stateless** widgets, **Widget Trees**, and the fundamental **Build Context**.
* **State Management:** Implementing and comparing various state management solutions (e.g., Provider, Riverpod, Bloc) within small, focused features.
* **UI/UX Mastery:** Creating responsive layouts using `Row`, `Column`, `Flex`, and `CustomPainter` for different screen sizes.
* **External Integration:** Practicing **API calls** (REST/GraphQL), data parsing, and local data persistence (e.g., using `shared_preferences` or databases).
* **Code Quality:** Focusing on clean architecture, Dart language idioms, and writing effective unit and widget tests.

## üß© Features Implemented So Far

As part of my learning journey, I‚Äôve already built:

- ‚è± **Pomodoro Timer** ‚Äì A customizable timer with adjustable settings for focused work and short breaks.  
- üí¨ **Motivational Quotes Page** ‚Äì Uses the free [ZenQuotes API](https://zenquotes.io) with `FutureBuilder` to fetch and display inspirational quotes, complete with pull-to-refresh and error handling.
